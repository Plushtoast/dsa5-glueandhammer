## Current Features
* Button to configure the module "Splatter" for TDE/DSA in the settings
* CSS (style) fix for the modules:

    - Soundscape

* Config file for automated animations (you are invited to submit your own or extend the existing one)
    - Open automated animations settings (extra module)
    - load the configuration file located in modules/dsa5-glueandhammer/configs/automatedanimations
